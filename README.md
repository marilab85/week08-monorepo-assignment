This will be my week's assignment
After checking out the last part of the class that I miss, I realized that I had done most of the assingment myself. I nearly could have submitted it on time. 

as I mentioned before, it was hard to try to keep up in a timezone that different. Hopefully everything will be in place, and if don't know Adam Grant, you do now ...lol

I didn't do anything different from class other than add my own books and links. Hopefully enough for the grade.

Thank you, Frankie and Bertie for everything!
